Question:
How would you handle late-arriving data in a streaming pipeline
while maintaining accurate aggregations?

Answer:
1)Event Time, Processing Time
To handle late data, I use Event Time — the timestamp from the message itself.
This ensures the data goes into the correct time interval, even if it arrives late

2)Upserts
The pipeline is executed in any case, after upsert in the database datas are correct.

Question:
How would you monitor and alert on data quality issues in your
pipelines?

Answer:
1)Not strict validation
2)Use a threshold.
  For example threshold is 15. We expected only letter for field name, but there is a name which contains 27 letters.
  It looks strange, we mark that field, for checking.
